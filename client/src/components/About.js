    <h2>Application Coding Details</h2>
    <p>
        This application utilizes elements of React (JavaScript, CSS, HTML, JSX) and Ruby on Rails to create a cohesive front and back end experience. An individual users data persists to a backend database so that any changes that user has made will persist as the page is updated.
